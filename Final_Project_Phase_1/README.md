# Final Project - Phase 1

In this project I will be demonstrating the importance of understanding traffic patterns through statistical analysis which is crucial for effective traffic management. 

Beginning with calculating the average traffic volume for each hour of the day, transportation authorities can identify peak periods and allocate resources accordingly, ensuring optimal traffic flow and reducing congestion.

The maximum and minimum traffic volumes recorded for each segment provide essential insights to help engineers design appropriate infrastructure that can handle both typical and extreme traffic conditions. 

Identifying outliers and unusual patterns in the traffic data is necessary for detecting potential issues such as accidents, and road closures.

Analyzing the distribution of traffic volumes across different time periods also enables transportation planners to understand the variability and predictability of traffic flow.

## Analytical Questions based on Data

**Traffic_Data_Volume**

This dataset describes the Traffic Volume in NYC. Only Traffic data from the year 2019 during the months September -> December. With the data extracted, I provided some questions below that can be answered based on the insights gathered from the data.

* What is the average traffic volume for each hour of the day? 
* What are the maximum and minimum traffic volumes recorded for each segment?
* Are there any outliers or unusual patterns in the traffic data?
* What is the distribution of traffic volumes across different time periods?
