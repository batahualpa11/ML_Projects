## Question 1

What is the most common sentiment observed in your sample of 50 reviews according to your OpenAI labeled data?

- The most common sentiment is 'negative' in the sample of 50 reviews. Although, there are a couple of 'positive' and 'neutral'.

## Question 2

How reliable do you believe these labels are? Look at the respective labels OpenAI has generated for specific reviews, does it seem like the large language model accurately described the user's review? What risk do model hallucinations introduce into this analysis?

- I believe some labels are reliable, however some tend to describe a review of the overall company instead of the product. Therefore, for some reviews I would suggest that they are irrelevant. The risk that they introduce is that they introduce opinionated results and output based on the data that was fed into the LLM.

## Question 3

Using the most common sentiment, what would you recommend to this Coconut Water producer to improve customer satisfaction? Should they continue to pursue current market/product outcomes, or does there exist an opportunity for this business to improve its product?

- After further data analysis, it seems that the majority of people agree 'negatively' to the taste of the beverage. Therefore, the company should revisit the product testing process to ensure the majority of consumers agree 'positively' to the taste of the beverage.
