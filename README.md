### Instructions

In the folder Project_1, the main objective is to be an introduction to Python through the means of developing a heart rate monitoring system.

Within this project it was aimed to be a culmination of what has been learned in Phase 1 (for-loops, I/O, if-statments, functions, data manipulation, data processing, etc.). 

#### Objective

The main reason to why this GitHub Repository was created is to keep my thinking process for my records. As well as demonstrate my technical learning for future career ambitions.
