## Question 1

Take a look at the file labeled `data/phase0.txt`. Why might we have missing values or values that state "NO DATA" in this dataset? While we are currently ignoring these values, what might be the risk of filtering these values out?

- In the file labeled data/phase0.txt we have missing values or "NO DATA" in the dataset to replicate how messy data is often presented in the workforce, gain the skill to realize these inconsistencies, and ultimately navigate how to minimize the chance of errors in our data. The risk of filtering these values is that they can potentially show us the story on what might have caused this. 

## Question 2

During sleep, we expect maximum heart rate of a phase to be **lower** than the maximum heart rate of all other phases. Observe the visualizations and descriptive statistics that you've calculated. Using these findings, in which phase does sleep occur? Mention numerical details that back your findings.

- In all each phase other than phase 0, it is clearly visible the maximum or peak heart rate is 98. Other phases pass through this heart rate maximum which gives clearly indication that during phase 0, it is the phase in which sleeping/resting occurs.

## Question 3

During exercise, we expect the maximum heart rate of a phase to be **higher** the maximum heart rate of all other phases. Observe the visualizations and descriptive statistics that you've calculated. Using these findings, in which phase(s) does exercise occur? Mention numerical details that back your findings. 

- In all each phase other than phase 2, it is clearly visible the maximum or peak heart rate is 120. Other phases pass through this heart rate maximum which gives clearly indication that during phase 2, it is the phase in which exercise occurs.

## Question 4

During regular periods of awake activity, we expect the average heart rate of a phase to be relatively **lower** than the average heart rate of other phases, but we also expect standard deviation to be **higher**. In which phase do we notice this trend?

- In all each phase other than phase 0, it is clearly visible the maximum or peak heart rate is >100. Other phases pass through this heart rate maximum which gives clearly indication that during phase 0, it is the phase in which awake activity occurs. We also see the heart rate go up and down at a pretty conistent rate.
